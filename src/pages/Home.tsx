                    Hey! I am Andrew.<br/>
                    I build interactive websites that<br/>
                    run across platforms & devices.
                    I am a full-stack developer with over a decade of experience. I work with agencies across the globe to create high performance and rich interactive websites that work across platforms & devices.
                    Although I'm very familiar with using frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, I can construct websites with hand-coded HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript.
                    With a stong emphasis on "Progressive Enhancement", I look for creative ways to push the boundaries of a websites front-end code without compromsing on browser support and performance.
                    In a quest for always keeping up with the latest technologies, I read books, attend conferences and meetups.

                    Fast-forward to today, and I've had the privilege of working at{' '}. My
                    main focus these days is creating games
